        <h3>Growth process with personality</h3>
        <p>I was a child with a strong curiosity in my childhood, so I preferred to learn everything new. From now on I am
        still prefer to study new one. I was experienced homestay during a month with Thai family who I knew a Thai
        friend when I am studying in English on the Internet, and I experienced Thai culture at the first time. At that time
        I attracted to Thai’s easygoing mind and soft Thai language intonation, so I started to learned Thai language. After
        that I have been Thailand four-times more, I realized not only teenager’s interest but also Thai’s interest to go over
        to Korean culture or products during I stayed with Thai students 6 months in Thailand.
        </p>

        <p>Also, I am capable of solving problem between people. Seen from my experience, when I was living in dormitory,
        there were two students whom Chinese and Russian. They were living together in the same room. But, there were
        lots of problems. They didn’t know each their country culture. Russian regard individual space as important,
        Chinese consider relations and sharing as important, so I solved problems by explaining and making them
        understand each culture.
        So because of this, I will mediate between people as I grasp their culture with a national trait.
        </p>

        <h3>College life and activities</h3>

        <p>I am able to speak English, Thai and Korean. I wanted to learn not only language but also various cultures, so I
        exchanged cultures with language while I hang out with lots of foreign friends in the college. Especially, I made
        a friend who is a Thai Buddhist monk as an accidental opportunity. He invited me to his temple event called
        Thailand Buddhism Culture Youth Exchange. So I participated as a staff and a participant in a month. There is a
        Korean, it happened problems with Thai staffs. So I tried to solve problems between them as arbitrator used
        Korean, Thai, and English. Also, I had a chance to show leadership in Dongnae-eupseong History Festival as
        </p>
        <h3>interpreter leader volunteer.</h3>

        <p>I am sure that I contribute to communicate between people well.
        Reason for application with plan
        These experience made me sure that I can solve the problems between Thai and Korean, also I strong interest in
        culture exchange, so I apply to this position which I think suitable.
        I will be a man with sociability and communication ability who connecting each countries culture as act as a
        bridge.
